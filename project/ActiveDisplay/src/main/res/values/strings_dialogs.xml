        <b>How can I uninstall this app?</b>
        Go to Settings > Security > <a href="acdisplay_internal://launch_device_admins_activity">Device Administrators</a> and uncheck AcDisplay.
        You can now <a href="acdisplay_internal://uninstall">uninstall</a> AcDisplay normally.<br/>
        <br/>
        <b>What is an active mode?</b>
        Active mode uses the device\'s sensors to wake your device up when you need it.
        This works great if you want to pull your device from your pocket and get a quick glimpse at the notifications you\'ve received.
        Active mode doesn\'t keep the CPU running so you shouldn\'t see a big difference in battery consumption.
